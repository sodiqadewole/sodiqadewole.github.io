I am a machine learning scientist at Microsoft, working on machine learning algorithms for business process optimization. I also teach graduate level deep learning course at the University of Virginia School of Data Science.

My interest are in general machine learning, deep representation learning, graph neural network, computer vision, natural language processing and multimodal learning.
