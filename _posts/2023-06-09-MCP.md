Model Context Protocol
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source protocol introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 to standardize the way Large / Small Language Models integrate and share data with external tools, systems and data sources.


MCP allows users build truly agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs and SLMs. Language models often require integration with data and tools. Benefits of MCP includes:

- Flexibility to integrate LLMs and SLMs with a growing list of pre-built tools to directly plug into.
- The flexibility to leverage commoditized LLM offering users the room to switch between LLM providers and vendors.
- Best practices for securing your data within on-premise infrastructure.

#### MCP Servers

MCP servers relies on three (3) transport mechanisms:
- Standard Input Output: here servers run as a subprocess of users application running locally.
- HTTP over Server Side Encryption: servers run remotely and can be connected to via a url.
- Streamable HTTP where servers run remotely using the streamable HTTP transport defined in the MCP specification.
